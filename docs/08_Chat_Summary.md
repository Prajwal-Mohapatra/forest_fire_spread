from predict import predict_fire_probability
from ca_engine import run_quick_simulation
from ml_ca_bridge import MLCABridge

# No code duplication - only orchestration
results = bridge.run_complete_pipeline(params)
```

**Benefits Realized**:
- Single source of truth for each component

       'spatial_consistency',
       'value_ranges_valid', 
       'missing_data_acceptable',
       'temporal_alignment',
       'projection_consistency'
   ]
   ```

2. **Model Validation**:
   - Cross-validation on held-out dates

## Technical Challenge Resolutions

### Memory Management for Large-Scale Simulation

**Challenge**: GPU memory limitations for full-state simulation

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **TensorFlow memory growth**: Prevent allocation of all GPU memory
2. **Mixed precision**: Use float16 where accuracy permits
3. **Efficient operations**: Use TensorFlow ops instead of Python loops
4. **Memory monitoring**: Track usage and optimize allocation

```python
# GPU configuration
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
for gpu in gpus:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
```

### Real-time Web Interface Integration

**Challenge**: Connecting Python ML/CA backend with JavaScript frontend

**Solution Architecture**:
```javascript
// Frontend: React + WebSocket
const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');
socket.emit('start-simulation', simulationParams);
socket.on('simulation-progress', handleProgress);

// Backend: Node.js + Python subprocess
const pythonProcess = spawn('python', ['run_simulation.py', params]);
pythonProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    socket.emit('simulation-progress', JSON.parse(data));
});
```

**Key Insight**: Node.js provides clean bridge between web interface and Python processing.

### Handling Geospatial Data Complexity

**Challenge**: Managing coordinate systems, projections, and spatial alignment

**Standards Established**:
```python
# Consistent spatial reference
target_crs = 'EPSG:4326'  # WGS84
target_resolution = 0.000277778  # ~30m in degrees
target_bounds = (77.8, 28.6, 81.1, 31.1)  # Uttarakhand

# Alignment validation
def validate_spatial_consistency(dataset1, dataset2):
    assert dataset1.crs == dataset2.crs
    assert abs(dataset1.transform[0] - dataset2.transform[0]) < 1e-6
    # Additional checks...
```
