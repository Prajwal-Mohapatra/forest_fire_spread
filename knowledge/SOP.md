```

### **SOP-016: Detailed Project Documentation**
```
Based on the code and our discussions, analyze the code again, in detail, generate a folder, named `knowledge` in the root folder (if already present, add on to it) and add the following documentation in as much detail as possible:
- README file section for each component and all the component that created or worked on in this session
- progress report for the project, including from where we started, where we are know, and where we are heading
- detailed summarization of the chat messages, important information, conclusions from all the question answer sessions
- any other info related to the project should also be copied into the `knowledge` folder, which will be created in the root directory
- if any particular documentation is already present, then add onto it, in as much detail as possible
```

### **SOP-017: Knowledge Base Update**
```
Read through the existing `knowledge` folder documentation thoroughly. Then analyze the current project state and add/update the following:
- Document any new components, files, or features added since last update
- Update progress report with recent developments and current status
- Add documentation for any code changes, bug fixes, or improvements
- Update integration points and architecture changes
- Record any new decisions, conclusions, or learnings
- Ensure all existing documentation reflects current project state
- Add timestamps to track documentation freshness
```

### **SOP-018: Read files without lazing around**
```
remember, read entire files thoroughly — no truncation. Always process code from the first line to the last, never stopping arbitrarily (e.g., after 50 or 100 lines). Each read operation must cover at least 1000 lines, and continue beyond that if needed to cover the full file. Analyze all code elements: functions, classes, variables, imports/exports, and structure. Avoid phrases like "truncated for brevity" or "rest omitted" — these reflect incomplete work. Your analysis and suggestions must reflect full-file understanding, referencing and connecting code across the entire file to ensure accurate, contextual recommendations. Incomplete reads lead to poor results — thoroughness is non-negotiable.
