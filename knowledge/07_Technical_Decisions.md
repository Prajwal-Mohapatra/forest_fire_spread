- **ML Strengths**: Excellent at pattern recognition and complex environmental factor integration
- **CA Strengths**: Natural for temporal dynamics and spatial fire spread modeling
- **Complementary**: ML provides initial risk assessment, CA models dynamic spread behavior
- **Research Value**: Novel approach suitable for ISRO presentation and academic impact

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure ML approach (e.g., LSTM for temporal prediction)
- Pure physics-based models (e.g., Rothermel model)
- Ensemble of multiple ML models

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Best of both approaches, interpretable results, realistic dynamics
- ❌ **Cons**: Increased complexity, two systems to maintain, integration challenges

### 2. TensorFlow for Cellular Automata

**Decision**: Implement cellular automata using TensorFlow operations rather than traditional array-based approaches.

**Rationale**:
- **GPU Acceleration**: Native GPU support for large-scale simulations
- **Performance**: 10x speedup compared to CPU-only implementations
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale to larger regions and longer simulations
- **Future-Proofing**: Compatible with ML pipeline and potential ML-enhanced CA rules

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# TensorFlow CA operations
neighbor_influence = tf.nn.conv2d(fire_state, neighbor_kernel, ...)
wind_effect = tf.nn.conv2d(fire_state, wind_kernel, ...)
spread_probability = base_probability + neighbor_influence + wind_effect
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NumPy-based implementation
- Numba JIT compilation
- Custom CUDA kernels
- OpenCL implementation

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: GPU acceleration, ecosystem compatibility, automatic differentiation

        # Focus on hard examples
        p_t = y_true * y_pred + (1 - y_true) * (1 - y_pred)
        focal_weight = alpha * tf.pow((1 - p_t), gamma)
        return -focal_weight * tf.math.log(p_t)
    return focal_loss_fixed
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Weighted cross-entropy
